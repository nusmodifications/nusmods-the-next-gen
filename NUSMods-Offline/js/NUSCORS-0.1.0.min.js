It examines accounting from an external user's perspective: an external user being an investor or a creditor. Such users would need to understand financial accounting in order to make investing or lending decisions. However, to attain a good understanding, it is also necessary to be familiar with how the information is derived. Therefore, students would learn how to prepare the reports or statements resulting from financial accounting and how to use them for decision-making.","The course provides an introduction to financial accounting.

However, to attain a good understanding, it is also necessary to be familiar with how the information are derived. Therefore, students would learn how to prepare the reports or statements resulting from financial accounting and how to use them for decision-making.","This course covers major concepts, tools and techniques in managerial accounting. It provides students with an appreciation of how managerial accounting evolves with changes in the business environment and why the usefulness of managerial accounting systems depends on the organisational context. The emphasis is on the use of managerial accounting information for decision-making, planning, and controlling activities. Students are introduced to both traditional and contemporary managerial accounting concepts and techniques.","This course examines the conceptual and theoretical issues underlying the corporate accounting and reporting requirements under the US, International and Singapore Accounting Standards. This allows the students to understand the economic rationales behind the accounting treatment of major financial statement items. It also equips the students with skills in using financial information for decision-making. Topics to be covered include conceptual framework in financial reporting, accounting for foreign currency translation, leasing, preparation of consolidated financial statements, earnings quality management and off-balance sheet financing.",'The course examines various means by which control can be exercised and the types of accounting information that allow for different means of control. Topics to be covered include the nature of control, responsibility centers, economic value added, transfer pricing, strategic planning, budgeting, performance evaluation systems, executive compensation, control for differentiated strategies, control for multinational organisations. Students learn how control is exercised through case analyses, case presentations and in-class discussions. The case approach makes control "come alive" for the students with descriptions of control at various real organisations. The case presentations make the students think critically and strategically. The in-class discussions allow the students to evaluate the pros and cons of different approaches and solutions to control problems.',"This module provides the knowledge and understanding of the audit process required by assurance and attestation engagements. It aims to ensure students acquire the necessary attitude, skills, and knowledge for a career in auditing, in the accounting profession or in business management.","The primary aim of this course is to develop a solid understanding of the legal framework required in the operations of business entities especially companies. It covers the entire life-span of a business entity, namely from the formation of the entity to its liquidation. It also includes the various legal obligations and implications in operating the business entity. A secondary objective is to introduce the pertinent provisions of securities legislation such as the Securities & Futures Act and the Takeover Code.","This module introduces students to the basic concepts of income taxation in Singapore. Since a large portion of a business organisation's profits goes towards the payment of income tax, it is absolutely crucial for students to have an understanding of how tax works and how to legally minimize it. This module is relevant to those who wish to work in the fields of accounting, consulting or financial management.","This course explores in greater depth complex financial reporting topics introduced in ACC1002 Financial Accounting and ACC3601 Corporate Accounting and Reporting, and it also examines issues relating to fair value accounting. The viewpoint is that of the preparer of financial statements. The discussion centres on the financial reporting issues affecting a firm's profitability and risk. This course is for students who expect to become CPAs."

Some of the topics covered include the following: 1. Is probability intuitive? A class exercise will be conducted where students are asked to generate sequences of real and fake random coin tosses and are asked to develop tests to detect the difference. 2. What is the role of randomization in the design of scientific experiments (for instance, why are patients randomly assigned to treatments in a medical trial)? We recreate a famous incident in which a tea time conversation led to a statistician conducting an experiment to test whether someone could distinguish whether milk had been added first or last to a cup of tea. 3. How has statistical thinking been used and abused in the history of IQ testing? 4. In the analysis of environmental problems like global warming scientific models are often used which are deterministic (roughly speaking, such models predict a definite output for a given input). A statistical model on the other hand gives predictions in the form of probabilities of different possible outcomes. How can the deep physical understanding embedded in the deterministic models be reconciled with statistical approaches to quantifying uncertainty and risk, and why is quantifying uncertainty important? 5. How can fake random numbers generated on a computer by non-random rules sometimes do complicated calculations that aren’t easily done by other means? 6. Why is statistical thinking so crucial in modern scientific enquiries in which massive databases of mostly uninteresting information are being searched for interesting features (in astronomy, genetics and market research for example)?"

Analogy is an important factor in preparing, if not predicting, new concepts while an experience-based intuition can sometimes be an obstacle. The objective of this seminar module is to present case studies of the creative role of analogy in mathematics and of the ground-breaking importance of "counter-intuition" in modern mathematics. A wealth of examples of both can be found in geometry, number theory, analysis, algebra, logic, set theory and theoretical computer science. Students of this module are expected to source for relevant material in books, journals and the internet under the guidance of the lecturer. The emphasis, however, will be on the spirit of the mathematical enterprise rather than on the technical mastery. To illustrate the use of analogy and intuition in problem solving, some elementary problems and puzzles will be posed in class for attempt and discussion. The main prerequisite for this module is an inquiring mind open to new ideas.

It is well recognized by the world’s scientific, industrial and political communities that the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has been steadily increasing due to human activities and economic development, which accelerates the greenhouse effect. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) mandated a reduction of CO2 emission levels to below those of 1990. To reduce the CO2 emission and maintain a desired balance in atmosphere, new technologies have been developed. CO2 capture and storage is one of the approaches. It is also possible to convert CO2 to some reusable hydrocarbons or chemicals through physical, chemical and biological processes. The most important challenge is how to activate CO2 economically as it has high thermodynamic stability. Solar energy should be one of the best candidates because it is totally clean and abundant. Consequently, the highly efficient and selective photochemical reduction systems for CO2 are highly desired. In addition, alternative energy resources and technologies also play vital roles in the reduction of CO2 emission.","This seminar module traces the developments in ideas of space and time, with particular references to theoretical and observational cosmology, starting from Newtonian mechanics, Einstein’s relativity, Hubble’s observations, the Big Bang, black holes, dark energy to recent ideas in the origin and fate of the Universe.

It also allows students to engage with emerging issues that are likely to become focal points in shaping future debates among political geographers. The aim of the module is to explore the co-constitutive relationship between politics and space. As the political organization of society has spatial consequences, so too does geography influence our understanding of political relationships. These relations are negotiated and contested in multiple ways that cut across different locations, scales, and temporalities. Accordingly, we will examine political concerns, disputes, accommodations, and consequences from a geographical perspective, where students can expect to acquire a critical appreciation for the historical trajectories and evolving implications of states, sovereignty, territoriality, nationalism, colonialism, democracy, ethnic conflict, policing and crime, terrorism, war, environmental justice, and political activism.","This module aims to introduce students to the basic concepts and techniques for the manipulation, analysis, and the graphic representation of geographic information.

Philosophy of film is a sub-branch of aesthetics; many questions and puzzles about the nature and value of art have filmic analogues. (Plato's parable of the cave is, in effect, the world's first philosophy of film.) Philosophy in film concerns films that may be said to express abstract ideas, even arguments. (Certain films may even be thought-experiments, in effect.) Questions: are philosophical films good films? Are they good philosophy? The module is intended for majors but - film being a popular medium - will predictably appeal to non-majors as well. (This module is offered as special topics only)","The module examines representations of politics in film and television and considers the ways in which they become politically controversial as objects of regulation and censorship, economic commodities or projections of cultural ‘soft power’.

Our starting point is a conception of ourselves as free and conscious beings equipped with bodies that allow us to observe and explore a familiar external world. Successive lectures investigate alternative conceptions of the human condition, such as ones in which we are unfree, or non-spirituous, or inhabit a world whose fundamental nature is hidden from our view. Different conceptions bear differently on the further question of what we should value and why. Discussion is both argument-driven and historically informed.","An introduction to a spectrum of philosophical issues concerning modern science. These range from explaining the development of science, including a comparison with traditional approaches, to understanding nature in both the West and the East, to problems of the rationality of science. This will also involve a historical study of the development of philosophy of science in the Western tradition, from Bacon and Hume, through Mill, to Popper, Kuhn and Feyerabend.","This module will introduce students to some of the major political philosophers in the Western tradition by examining their different views on such issues as the nature and basis of justice, its relation to equality and liberty, the justification of the state, and the basis of political obligation.","This course is designed to survey the history of Indian philosophy both classical and modern. The course will begin with lectures on the Rig Veda and the Upanishads.

Philosophy of film is a sub-branch of aesthetics; many questions and puzzles about the nature and value of art have filmic analogues. (Plato's parable of the cave is, in effect, the world's first philosophy of film.) Philosophy in film concerns films that may be said to express abstract ideas, even arguments. (Certain films may even be thought-experiments, in effect.) Questions: are philosophical films good films? Are they good philosophy? The module is intended for majors but - film being a popular medium - will predictably appeal to non-majors as well. (This module is offered as special topics only)","What is the nature of mind and its relation to physical body? The mental realm is among the last great unknowns in the modern view of sentient beings and their place in the Universe and is a fertile field of philosophical inquiry. This module examines central conceptual issues surrounding the idea of mind and its relation to physical body. These include the distinction between the mental and the physical, the nature of consciousness, personal identity, disembodied existence, mental representation, and the attempt to tame the mental in purely physical terms.","Epistemology is the study of knowledge. Epistemologists want to know what knowledge is, how we acquire it, and how we should respond to arguments for philosophical scepticism, according to which there is very little that we know. We shall read the works of philosophers who have grappled with such perennial issues in philosophy, and explore and discuss various theories of knowledge. Along the way, we shall also discuss related issues having to do with justification, rationality, and the reliability of memory, testimony, intuition, sensory perception, and inductive reasoning.","This is the first half of a two-part course which offers an introduction to philosophical debate in the Warring States period of ancient China, the Classical Age of Chinese Philosophy and the seedbed from which grew all of the native currents of thought that survived from traditional China. It will begin by considering the intellectual-historical background to the ancient philosophies and focus primarily on the Confucius (the Analects), Mozi, Yang Zhu, Mencius and Laozi, closing with a brief introduction to some of the later developments that will be covered more fully in Part II. The approach of the course will be both historical and critical, and we will attempt to both situate Classical Chinese philosophical discourse in its intellectual-historical context and to bring out its continuing relevance.","This module is concerned with an area in Moral Philosophy called 'meta-ethics'. Meta-ethics is a discussion of the nature of ethics. It is a second-order, reflective activity about ethics, and not a first-order discussion of the rights and wrongs of particular issues within ethics. Beginning with non-naturalism, the module proceeds to discuss emotivism, prescriptivism, descriptivism or naturalism, culminating in current discussion of moral realism.","This module, designed for students with some philosophical training in both western and non-western philosophy, brings together traditions of philosophy that have developed in relative isolation from one another for the purpose of comparing how different cultures have approached and thematized major issues such as knowledge, truth, values (ethical, religious, social, political and aesthetic) and the practices they inform, language and the place of the human. It aims to elucidate the assumptions implicit in different ways of thinking about these issues and investigate how issues may be related in the light of these assumptions.","Aristotle is one of the two most important ancient Greek philosophers. This module complements the level 2000 module, PH 2222 Greek Philosophy (Socrates and Plato), and adds to the preparation for the Honours seminar on Greek Thinkers. Readings will be selected from various works representing the wide range of Aristotle’s philosophical interests and achievements. In-depth exploration of a specific area (e.g. metaphysics, or ethics) or topic (e.g. theory of the soul or practical wisdom) will focus on one or two key texts. The module may include later Hellenistic philosophy (e.g. Epicureanism, stoicism, or scepticism) or contemporary development of Aristotle’s philosophy.","This module is a study of the main contending contemporary views about goodness and virtue, principles of moral evaluation, and moral decision-making. These include deontological, consequentialist, and contemporary virtuebased and contractarian theories. Emphasis will be placed on securing a thorough understanding the arguments used to derive fundamental moral principles and to justify claims about our moral obligations. Such study aims to reveal the kinds of issues that are involved in analyzing what constitutes rational considerations for moral action, and the strengths and weaknesses of the rival theories.","Plato holds that the world of sensible objects is a mere shadow of an ideal realm that transcends experience. Locke maintains that sensible objects have intrinsic natures that are exhausted by a small number of basic spatial and temporal properties. Kant argues that we can never know the natures of things in themselves, beyond the fact that they give us certain senseimpressions. Mill construes a physical object as a bare propensity for sensations to occur in certain patterns. In this module, students engage with the major metaphysical systems of Western philosophy, examining how each coordinates subjective experience with objective reality.","Topics at the intersection of philosophy of mind and language, such as whether thought depends on talk or vice versa, whether we think in words or images, whether those words are words of English or a sui generis mental language just for thinking, whether animals which can’t talk can think and whether the mind is like a computer. These questions are central to contemporary philosophy and language and are also an important case study in the relationship between the methods of analysis, experiment and introspection in philosophical psychology.","This module examines different issues in meta-ethics or normative ethics. It asks questions such as: Can ought be derived from is? Are there natural laws? Is morality about an agent’s character or actions? Are actions morally justified by consequences or compliance with moral laws or principles? It may also examine and assess different schools of moral philosophy, such as utilitarianism, Kantian ethics or virtue ethics, or a current debate among moral philosophers, for example, the nature and role of intuition, or emotions, in acting morally.","A study of the work of a major figure in philosophy. The philosopher studied may be from the Asian or Western tradition, from any period up to the present day. The philosopher selected may be someone important who has not been given much coverage in other courses.","This course will deal with the thought of the four major classical phenomenologists: Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Jean Paul Sartre. Readings will be selected from Husserl's Ideas and Cartesian Meditations, Heidegger's Being and Time, Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception and Sartre's Being and Nothingness.","This module deals with specific topics of current interest and controversy in Western philosophy. The topics to be discussed may be in, but are not limited to, philosophy of science, philosophy of language, philosophy of psychology, epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, or social and political philosophy.","The module examines at least one recent movement in Continental European Philosophy. Recently, the module has been concerned with Philosophical Hermeneutics. Objectives: (1) Promote understanding of the main arguments in one or more of the recent movements in Continental Philosophy, (2) Familiarize students with the main debates, (3) Encourage further work in Continental Philosophy. Topics covered include hermeneutics, Critical Theory and post-structuralism.","Environmental issues are now in the forefront of global attention. Our current environmental problems may arguably be said to ultimately trace their roots to (implicit) metaphysical assumptions, to cultural or religious attitudes towards the natural world, to ethical perspectives that do not accord moral consideration to nonhumans. This module will involve a critical and thorough discussion of specific topics in environmental philosophy. These may include topics in both Eastern and Western environmental traditions. Examples of topics that may be discussed are: the ethical problem of future generations, intrinsic values in nature, varieties of eco-feminism, and ecology in Neo-Confucian thought.","This module introduces students to Classical Chinese through close reading and practice at translation of selected passages from philosophical texts, including a philosophically oriented grammatical introduction in English to the Classical Chinese language.

Both classical models of cognition and connectionist models will be considered. There will be several sessions of computer simulation of basic connectionist models. This course is mounted for students interested in how we might study how the mind works.",'This module introduces recent research findings in Cognitive Neuroscience - in particular, functional brain imaging (fMRI and ERP). We will explore whether brain imaging techniques have illuminated what each part of the brain actually does, and how these different parts interact functionally, before finally discussing recent applications of such findings. Two currently popular application areas are brain-machine/computer interfaces (using brain-waves to directly control robotic devices) and creating new "sensory abilities" in those people who have sensory impairments (e.g., the blind or deaf). The style of the course will be an informal one, and the "lectures" should be treated more like seminars/discussions. The emphasis will therefore rely heavily on preparation work outside the lectures that culminates in a fruitful debate during the lectures. To facilitate this style, several lectures will begin with students\' critiques of research articles before "opening up the floor" for general discussion.',"This module deals with contemporary social psychology. Topics include cognitive and learning perspectives in social psychology, quantitative methods in social psychology, attitudes and attitude change, attribution and social perception, altruism and aggression, sex roles, interpersonal attraction, social influence, leadership and power, intergroup relations, and cultural psychology.

The theoretical component will introduce the semiotic approach to accessing and analyzing both the dramatic and the performance texts, serving as a value-neutral system with which to evaluate classical and contemporary Asian and Western performance traditions. The theoretical component will also conduct a broad survey of the influential theories of theatre & performance from the 20th century to the present, assessing their impact on contemporary global performance practices. Through the practical sessions, students will experience hands-on the various aspects of a stage production, from acting, directing to design and stage management.","This module provides a broad historical overview of Western theatrical conventions beginning with the Ancient Greeks, continuing through the Medieval period and the Renaissance era to Neoclassicism. Representative plays will be studied in detail, and dramatic theory and criticism, from Plato and Aristotle to Hedelin d'Aubignac and Boileau will be placed against historical contexts, thus enabling students to see the tripartite relationship between history, theory and praxis. The module is targeted at Theatre majors and other students interested in the foundations and early history of Western Theatre.","This module focuses on the classical theatre forms of India, China, and Japan. Each tradition is examined within its socio-cultural context. Textual analysis of classical scripts from Sanskrit drama, Chinese opera, and Japanese theatre will also be conducted. Students' learning experience is often constructed in stimulated theatre settings to promote their creativity and to provide them with a working knowledge of performing arts. Students interested in theatre studies, South Asian studies, Chinese studies, and Japanese studies may particularly benefit from this module.","This module focuses on key figures and aspects of contemporary performance as a means of learning about innovative approaches to theatre practice. Taking the works of a significant dramatist, director, theorist or theatre/performance genre as their starting point, students will investigate the resulting aesthetic and conceptual innovations, and explore their implications for current approaches to performance making more generally. As such, the module combines creative and critical practice, and features a variety of reflective, analytical and practical assessment tasks, including a group performance project.","This module will explore the aesthetic or instrumentalist role of the arts in society and assess its implications on cultural policy, before evaluating different models of state subvention in the arts, from the arm's length approach to the interventionist, incentive and laissez-faire models. In the process, key contemporary policy issues, relating to the civilizing mission of the arts, the notion of identity in a postmodern intercultural situation, the twin demands of nationalism and internationalism, and the questions of corporate sponsorship versus the welfare state will be addressed, with particular emphasis on the Singaporean context.","Actors and their craft stand at the centre of many theatrical traditions. Yet what is acting is, and who actors are, remain subjects of intense fascination, which continue to be explored in live performance, as well as through writings by practitioners, scholars and critics. This module combines practical workshops and critical reading to explore diverse approaches to acting and to investigate the role and status of the actor within the art form of theatre, and in society at large. Focusing on actor development and the process of acting, assessment tasks highlight the importance of participation, reflection and presentation.","This module focuses on the close reading of dramatic texts in order to study the dynamic relationship between text & performance. Through the examination of 4 major modern playwrights working in different historical, geographical and cultural contexts, this course will explore the development of modern drama in the 20th century, the significance of text as the basis of theatrical realization, the variety of staging possibilities engendered by the dramaturgy of the play-text, and the synergistic partnership of word and action in creating the huge variety of text-based theatre in the 20th century.","This module focuses on the conventions of a variety of film genres and styles, ranging from Hollywood and Chinese cinemas to Bollywood and animation. It traces the development of each genre, examining its defining characteristics, the role and influence of the star system and individual stars such as actors and directors, and its relations to other film styles and industries. Through a group creative project, students will make a film that involves the practical application of critical ideas.","In Twentieth Century Asia, theatre-makers played a key role in working out what it meant to be modern. Absorbing international influences, they created new forms and identities for the stage and for society. This module identifies and analyses these and other features of modern drama in Asia by focusing on three periods when cultural interactions and aesthetic innovations took place: the early twentieth century, when Western theatre methodologies were imported; the sixties, when theatre became a powerful tool for political activism; and the recent period of regional theatre collaborations.","This module focuses on performance as a major component in the fabric of our everyday lives, especially in the ways we observe and absorb the myriad performances that surround us, both `mediated' and `live'. Through initial discussions, presentations and workshops we will explore notions of authenticity and transformation in performance, with particular focus on cinema, television, advertising and other popular media. Various theoretical models will be considered, including those that relate to avant-garde and experimental performance. A final project will be developed over several weeks, in which the students work in groups to create a short video that integrates these approaches with their own ideas about performance.","This module investigates a wide range of classical Asian dramatic texts, including masterpieces from Indian Sanskrit theatre, Chinese opera, and Japanese Noh and Kabuki. The social milieus in which the drama evolved are examined, and the illusionary world which ancient theatergoers imagined are reconstructed. The module treats dramatic literature as a vital component of living theatre, not as reading material, and thus complements TS3237, which teaches the staging practices of Asian theatre. Towards the end of the semester, Western canonical dramaturgy serves as a comparative reference to Asian materials, which enhances intercultural study or practice in other modules.","This module provides Arts 3 students majoring in Theatre Studies with the opportunity of an internship project in theatre organizations. It matches individual students' interests and skills with internship roles in stagecraft, stage production, event planning, theatre in education, research and administration offered by theatre companies. Through research papers, regular reports, and a final presentation, students are trained to integrate theoretical knowledge with practical application, develop skills in teamwork and problem-solving, and form research parameters and gather data to address issues in theatre practice from a critical perspective. Students are selected competitively on the basis of interviews and portfolios."
,"This is not a course about Postmodernism. This is a course examining the relationship between Postmodernism and Theatre, their tensions and complements. The course will examine notions of theatricality and performativity that have come to characterise Postmodernism. Related ideas of simulacra and rehearsal, occularism and spectatorship, self-consciousness and self-reflexivity will be debated and discussed. Postmodernism as style, attitude and as mode will be pitched against performance aesthetics and theatre techniques to further explore the relationship between the two. The course will also locate Singapore theatre practices in the context of a global postmodernity.",'This module examines popular media-mediated events "as" performance. The module will investigate the way in which \'mediatised\'(i.e. media-mediated) and popular events "perform" and shape the audience\'s perception of reality. Conversely, the module will also examine how media-mediated performance is influenced by audience interests and perceptions. The focus will be on popular media-mediated events like sports, reality TV, the internet to illustrate how they constitute different modes of performances while sharing similar performativities. The module will also focus on cross-genre, inter-disciplinary performances while also examining notions of the spectacular and spectacle in contemporary visual culture.',"This module provides a study of how the literary and performance traditions associated with Shakespeare's work are mobilized and transformed by the visual cultures of contemporary cinema. Through the intersections between the mediums of the dramatic text, theatre and film, the course examines central issues that shape Shakespeare's currency and circulation in the cinema: the values attached to authenticity and performance traditions, the Shakespearean actor, the appropriation and parody of the \"universality\" of Shakespeare, and the transformation of the meaningfulness of his plays through visuality and spectacle.","Doing performance can teach us things that watching it cannot. This module uses performance practice as a research methodology to investigate otherwise inaccessible questions of creativity, embodiment, and performance processes. The three main components of the module include: defining a research question, designing and conducting experiments/observations, presenting the outcomes. Students will conceptualize and execute their own research project, in a relationship of collaborative research with artists. The nature of the project determines the resulting presentation: multi-media talk, lecture-demonstration, or short performance or workshop. The module will also focus on case studies from a range of cultural and stylistic sources.","The Honours Thesis is usually done in the second semester of a student's registration in the Honours Degree Programme.","The Independent Study Module is designed to enable the student to explore an approved topic within the discipline in depth. The student should approach a lecturer to work out an agreed topic, readings, and assignments for the module. A formal, written agreement is to be drawn up, giving a clear account of the topic, programme of study, assignments, evaluation, and other pertinent details. Head's and/or Honours Coordinator's approval of the written agreement is required. Regular meetings and reports are expected. Evaluation is based on 100% Continuous Assessment and must be worked out between the student and the lecturer prior to seeking departmental approval.","Live performance is a vibrant and dynamic art form, and innovations in aesthetics and technique mean that it is constantly changing. Over the course of this module, students will conduct a critical assessment of recent developments in performance practice, and of their implications for performance theory and analysis. Recent trends in performance and scholarship will be surveyed, informed by a combination of publications, electronic resources, and theatre-going. Students will be assessed on their capacity to develop informed responses to the work, to conduct and present independent research into current trends, and to reflect critically on the concept of the ‘contemporary’.","This module provides a broad-based critical and methodological foundation for advanced research in theatre and performance. Taking one example from each of three aspects of performance a script, a live performance, and a media/cultural performance the module trains students to examine and compare the critical positions and questions posed by a range of theoretical texts with different approaches, priorities and methodologies. Core topics are the mutually transformational modalities of textuality and performativity, live and mediated performance, and non-traditional critical and performance practices. Students are guided in formulating a research proposal and project, which forms the main coursework component.","The aim of the module is to expose students not only to arts with digital media, but also let them develop their own art works. Students practise the analysis and interpretation of arts and become familiar with the major shifts of the arts in the 20th century and the basics of postmodern aesthetics. During the production of creative works, the focus lies on the training of conceptual skills. Similarities between artistic and strategic creativity are investigated. The connection between art and leadership, the tradition of the avant-garde and a discussion about favourable conditions for innovation in a society serve to round up the module.","This course introduces the different theoretical approaches to urban design and provides the philosophical underpinnings to the various bodies of theories. The application of these theories to the design of urban environments will be examined. With a greater understanding of the various theories, this course will serve as a base from which students can develop their own convictions and approaches to urban design. It also examines the fundamentals of urban design and the factors in the related fields of urban planning, architecture and landscape architecture that influence the creation of urban spaces. The course aims to lead students to critically examine and investigate the many ways through which the city is imagined, developed, formed and occupied. There are two components to the course, lectures and seminars. Lectures will present the theoretical concepts and models of thought regarding urban design. Seminars focus on the discussion and interrogation of influential writings and case studies of urban projects, and present opportunities for students to interpret and debate the relevance and applications of these modes of thinking and acting on the built environment.","This course adopts an eclectic, multi-disciplinary approach towards leadership. Through a section on Core Ideas and Great Texts, it highlights the key tensions and complexities involved in leaders’ decision-making, exemplified in seminal thinkers’ work on how to determine the “right” and / or “good”; and explores how these tensions/complexities play out in a selection of Great Texts, both literary and philosophical. A section on Contemporary Issues applies the ideas of leadership tension/complexity to current leadership challenges. A student-selected USPitch Project provides a first-hand practical experience of the issues explored in earlier sections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Independent Study Module",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Independent Study Module",,"Independent Study Module",,,,,,"One of the most recent advances in the area of computer science and information theory is the emergence of a new notion, the concept of quantum information. The module aims to provide an introduction to the field of quantum computing. While very much a technology of the future, the module will examine some of the possibilities that the quantum world offers in advancing the capabilities of computers and how our notion of information has evolved. Essentially the module showcases, two major paradigm shifts; one from classical physics to quantum physics and the other from the standard Turing principle in computer science to its modern quantum counterpart.","Biodiversity conservation became one of the important environmental themes of global concern after UN Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The realisation that human development has to complement and not to compete with biological conservation ultimately developed into the famous Agenda 21. This protocol bound all the nations into accepting various responsibilities towards conservation of nature and natural resources. This module is aimed at imparting knowledge to students to help them understand and appreciate various concepts and issues concerning biodiversity and conservation at local, regional and global levels.","Chapbooks and Digital Poetry Module is designed for students who do not have a background in creative cultural productions and in poetry. It is structured to shaping across diverse disciplines a community of students who will experiment with aesthetic forms, discuss English literary traditions, and produce their own chapbooks and digital poetry projects. Situated in the Humanities and Social Sciences domain, each section of the module contributes to a progressive intellectual journey through the Western field of poetics, culminating in spoken word performances and an exhibition of participants’ chapbooks and new media projects.","Whereas the goal of many literacy studies is to determine who is literate or what counts as literacy, the goal of this module is to examine the political, economic, and social assumptions, factors, and effects of the distinction between literacy and illiteracy. Although such a study could take place within any national context, this module will focus on Singapore as a location for taking up this issue. Organized around the literacy narratives and histories of USP students older generations of Singaporeans, and people from other cultures and nations, this module explores the impact of the distinction between those who are literate and those who are not on Singaporean identity, history, politics, and ethics.",,"This module examines the evolution of our present theoretical understanding of some basic aspects of the physical world around us. It explores the role of certain primitive concepts of science and how these key ideas have been used to construct a coherent ‘mental’ picture of the physical world. The particular focus this semester will be on a wellestablished and ‘deterministic’ law of nature: the Law of Universal Gravity and how this led to Newton’s prediction of the motion of the planets. The module will also question, on a higher level, the nature of ‘scientific explanations’: how these are extended over time and inevitably get modified by having to take into account new ‘facts’ provided by observation and experiment.","The environmental crisis, manifested in air and water pollution, environmental degradation, the rate of extinction of animal and plant species, and the depletion of natural resources, has many different aspects, the most important being, arguably, the philosophical aspect. In this module, students will be introduced to the philosophical debate about environmental issues. The objective is to equip students with concepts and theories that will help them think about the environment at the fundamental level. Major topics include anthropocentrism and non-anthropocentrism, bio-centred ethics, deep ecology, eco-feminism and environmental virtues.","Creativity seems to be an overused and vague buzzword, though only few would deny its fundamental role in an economic system which relies on innovations as a driving force. So what actually is creative thinking, can we foster it or is it just a matter of inspiration? We will analyze different forms of creativity with examples from history, research, technology and the arts. Then we will practice creative thinking and explore strategies how to manage innovative teams. To show that creative strategic thinking plays a role in various domains of society we turn towards negotiation and deal-making.We conclude with ideas how to communicate new ideas best and a discussion on creative leadership.","How have artists, philosophers, and writers of fiction imagined the relation between humans and animals? Have they imagined humans as a species of animal, or as belonging to a realm of being that exceeds the lives of animals? What, if anything, distinguishes us from animals: language, clothing, reason, or something else? In this course we will examine some of the ways these questions have been explored in art, advertising, philosophy, and literature. Students will consider how we look at animals, read the views of influential philosophers, and immerse themselves in literary texts that imagine animals. The course will conclude with an examination of a provocative text by the novelist J. M. Coetzee, who stages a confrontation between philosophy and literature on the question of imagining animals.","This topic-based module develops quantitative reasoning skills through a structured analysis of an important but accessible problem, imparting to students the appreciation that, for many questions/issues, a quantitative analysis can provide the insight and clarity that complements and indeed moves beyond what might be gained through a qualitative approach. While the most important element of the class will be a hands-on quantitative exploration of the problem in question, students will conclude by considering the limits of quantitative analysis in the chosen case. This particular instance of the module is on the evaluation of DNA evidence in a court of law.","This topic-based module develops quantitative reasoning skills through a structured analysis of an important but accessible problem, imparting to students the appreciation that, for many questions/issues, a quantitative analysis can provide the insight and clarity that complements and moves beyond what might be gained through a qualitative approach. Epidemiology is the foundation of Public Health and is interdisciplinary per se. In this module, epidemiological methodology (study designs, causation, and statistical tests) will be introduced through an evidence-based investigation of the risk factors of non-communicable diseases and critical appraisals of scientific studies, to prepare students for their research in other disciplines.",'For a long time, the discipline of international relations (IR) has dominated the way people thought about world political events. This module introduces students to critical ways of thinking about traditional IR, and how such critiques pave the way for the study of global politics, which is usually on the wider array of transnational actors most of which are marginalised like refugees, sweatshop workers and child soldiers. The course examines the way marginalised transnational actors give rise to cultures of resistance through refugee poetry, activism, art, music, and film, in order to demonstrate how global politics can be mutually reconstructed from both "top-down" and "bottom-up" processes.',"If you live in a cave, you may be unaware of enthusiasm for African American art-forms, throughout Asia, in the last 10 years. But no matter where you live, it can be hard to gauge how much energy has sparked and flowed, for generations, between this part of the globe and what has been called “Afmerica.” This module introduces students to a few of the far-reaching conversations that have mapped the Black Pacific. Topics of special interest include history, literature and film in the past and the present-day.","This module examines the tension between ‘need’ to ‘develop’ and imperatives of conserving natural resources in the backdrop of enormous socio-economic and environmental challenges we face today. Sustainable development (SD) emerged as a response to confront these challenges; whether it has served its purpose or not remains debatable. Different scientific, technological, economic and political instruments encompassing sustainable development (SD) will be critically evaluated. The criticality of natural resources and their consumption patterns will be presented to the students. The need to engage local communities in new ways in social construction of SD would be discussed.","How does law affect people and society? How do people and society influence law? Can law bring about social change? In what ways? This course approaches the study of law as a social institution, and examines law, legal actors, and legal institutions from various perspectives such as sociology, psychology, political science, and legal scholarship. We will discuss theoretical perspectives on the relationship between law and society, the relationship between law and social behaviour, law in action in various social contexts, the role of law in social change, and the roles of lawyers, judges, and juries.","Emotions, it is often said, has no place in politics. Where the former is thought to be primal and unruly, the latter is regarded as the realm of reason, of pragmatic and thoughtful deliberations. But how accurate is such a view? Don’t emotions typically accompany our political judgments and actions? Might they perhaps condition such responses, priming them and orienting us towards certain political attitudes and dispositions? Organized around five emotions—fear, disgust, grief, compassion, and hope— this module explores how emotions circulate within political life, how they emerge and are deployed for the mobilization of identities, sovereign legitimacy, ethical responsibility, and resistance.",'What is "gender"? What kinds of definitions have been advanced or implied for this perplexing word? How have thinkers - in fields as diverse as anthropology, history, literature, philosophy, psychology, science studies, and sociology - helped to define and even invent this category that we call "gender"? How have these definitions changed the way we think? What kinds of problems have these definitions created? In this module, we will analyse various moments in intellectual history when there has been a struggle over the meaning of "gender" (and seemingly related terms like "sex" and "sexuality") in order to understand the term\'s function as a category of analysis.',"It is becoming increasingly popular in Singapore to identify oneself as Asian, to consume products and services that appear Asian in origin, and perhaps even to think of the future of the global economy and culture to be centred in this part of the world. However, considering the fact that such an intense fascination with Asianism is of a more recent origin a number of important questions are raised. How has the state attempted to convey Asia as a natural and unproblematic an entity? How is knowledge about it influenced and conditioned by changing social, political, and economic forces? Why did Singapore at its earliest historical phase seek to dissociate itself with the region, only to openly embrace it a few decades later? This module, therefore, introduces students to critical ways of challenging and contesting what is understood by the term Asia. Is it a geographical region, a political and cultural construction, or transnationalized space? In particular it provides students the theoretical tools needed to grapple with these questions, introduces cultural texts that could be used in assessing the way Asia is represented, and gives students opportunities for fieldwork and other out of classroom activities.","This module investigates three inter-connected questions: Can science prove that religion is irrational? When reason becomes so powerful that it dominates nature, what ethical problems will arise? Is reason or religious faith more suitable in providing a foundation for multiculturalism? These three questions, which are still much debated today, actually arose in the Age of Enlightenment, an 18th century intellectual movement so important that it shaped the modern West, and even, arguably, the East. We will examine representative Enlightenment treatises on these questions, and reflect on how beliefs and principles involved are still operative in our age.","This module teaches writing and critical thinking through a critical exploration of the notion of cosmopolitanism and its relation to colonialism. Topics discussed include the origin of cosmopolitanism, the relevance of cosmopolitanism as a moral ideal in the age of globalization, and the formation of cultural identity among diasporic Asians. The module thus provides the chance for students to reflect on the notion of global citizenship in the contemporary world, as well as their responsibilities as cosmopolitan citizens.","This module teaches writing and critical thinking through a critical exploration of theories of civic and public discourse as they were configured by the ancient Greeks. Topics discussed include the political, ethical, and emotional uses and impacts of civic discourse. The module thus provides the chance for students to gain a critical awareness of the natures of their own engagement with public discourses, to contextualise these discourses both locally and internationally, and to explore the possible futures of communities of which they are a part.","This module explores how monuments, memorials and other forms of public commemoration represent the past and influence culture and politics in the present. It takes a comparative approach, using case studies from different societies. The module highlights the complexity and contested nature of commemoration and memorialization. Although monuments and memorials may be intended to tell the “true” version of historical events, the end result often hides controversies that may have been part of the process of designing these structures. Similarly, the meanings attached to monuments and memorials can change dramatically over time, as societies change and these structures are reinterpreted.","This module examines the ways power, space, and pleasure are interconnected. The module is divided into three units. First, we will look at how space is related to questions of power, focusing in particular on surveillance. Then, in the second unit, we will consider more closely the relation between space, power and pleasure as exemplified in voyeurism and surveillance : here we will be watching people watching other people. Finally, we'll consider the relations between space, power and pleasure in Singapore, in particular as this applies to the tensions between traditional practices and urban planning in city spaces here.","This module will develop students' critical reading and writing abilities through an active, seminar-style engagement with a variety of materials related to the nature and impact of modern consumer culture. We will begin by examining a number of key theoretical positions concerning the relationship between human nature and the need or desire for material things. Once we have interrogated some of these arguments, we will examine the phenomenon of modern advertising and consider the extent to which individual ads shape our buying habits and even our values. The module concludes by investigating the relationship between today's corporations and youth culture.","Domestic life is routinely held up for admiration as pure or natural. But how many of us experience family time/space in that way? Challenging the truism that domesticity offers a refuge from the modern world, this module recognises that technology makes it possible for modern people to be, and feel, at home. Some relevant technologies involve engines or electronics. But others organise ideas about gender, room, place and belonging. By enhancing awareness of domesticity’s “constructed nature,” this module deepens understanding of home sweet home.","Depictions of ‘natives’, ‘primitives’ and ‘savages’ abound in the popular cultures of developed countries worldwide. In this module we will examine common stereotypes of native people and primitive cultures to uncover the underlying ideologies driving them, and analyze what cultural purpose such stereotypes serve in modern day life. We will seek to discern what palpable differences exist between primitive and modern people, and to confront the cultural and ethical conundrums entailed by those differences. Finally, we will explore how primitive people view modern society, and assess what the future may hold for native cultures in our fast globalizing world.","This module teaches writing and critical thinking by introducing students to the assumptions that inform, and the arguments for, different concepts and practices of justice. Students will engage topics such as human rights, the place and limits of legal institutions, justifications for civil disobedience, and whether violence is justified in the pursuit of justice. This module enables students to think critically about theories of justice and how these theories shape the pursuit of justice in political life.","The module provides an overview of geology – the science of the earth. An understanding of geology is important to many disciplines, providing information about the physical and chemical processes that determine the distribution of resources, location of hazards, operation of surface processes and the interaction between engineering structures and earth surface materials. The four components of the module begin with consideration of the earth’s structure and the role of plate tectonics, before considering the nature of earth surface materials and the functioning of earth surface systems.","This module allows CNM/Business double degree students to write an honours thesis that integrates their two areas of study—Communications and New Media and Business. Students taking this module must conduct an independent research project on an approved topic under the supervision of two faculty members (one from CNM and one from the School of Business). The maximum length of the thesis is 12,000 words.","The purpose of the Integrated Honours Dissertation is to provide DDP students with an opportunity to select and synthesise research topics from two distinct bodies of knowledge, and to present their findings logically and systematically in a clear and concise prose. Students are expected to demonstrate (i) a good understanding of relevant methodology and literature; (ii) the significance and relevance of the problem; (iii) logical and sound analysis; (iv) clear and effective presentation; and (v) achieve a balance between the learning objectives of both the Business course and the second course of study.","The objective of this module is to enable students to work on an individual integrated research project spanning over two semesters, with approximately 400 hours of workload. Students learn how to apply skills acquired in the classroom and also think of innovative ways of solving problems, and learn to work in a research environment. The project demonstrates a student’s work ethic, initiative, determination, and ability to think independently. On completion of the project, the student has to submit a dissertation describing the project work, and give an oral presentation before a panel of examiners.",,"This module is intended for students to conduct mini-research projects that make use of computational methods and informatics tools to solve specific biological problems or develop bioinformatics databases and software. In principle, each project is to be supervised by an academic staff from any department in the Faculty of Science.

These projects make use of computational methods and informatics tools to solve specific biological problems or develop bioinformatics databases and software. In principle, each project is to be supervised by an academic staff from any department in the Faculty of Science. Upon approval by the programme committee, a project can also be co-supervised by an academic staff at the School of Computing.","In addition to having a good academic record and technical foundation, students with good soft skills and some industrial attachment or internship experiences often stand a better chance when seeking for jobs. This module gives non-Applied Science students the opportunity to embark on internships during their undergraduate study. The module requires students to compete for position and perform a structured internship in a company/institution for 10-12 weeks during Special Term. Through regular meetings with the Academic Advisor and internship Supervisor, students explore how knowledge learnt in the curriculum can be transferred to perform technical assignments in an actual working environment.","In this module, students are challenged with practical experience in advanced bioinformatics research topics spanning database curation, literature text mining, and compute-intensive sequence and 3D structure analysis. Groups will design and carry out a pan-genomic analysis with a high-performance integrated database system. Individual students will learn to use animation software and raw biomolecular structure information as a platform for simulation and hypothesis testing.",null],prerequisite:[,,"Students must have completed BK1003 or BZ1002 or BH1002 or FNA1002 or FNA1002X or FNA1002E or ACC1002 or ACC1002X or BH1002E or CS1304 or EC3212 or EG1422 before they are allowed to take ACC2002.","FNA1002 or ACC1002","FNA2002 or ACC2002","FNA1002/ACC1002 and FNA2002/ACC2002 (Students who are not enrolled in the accounting or accounting-specialization program should seek Deans Office permission to read the module)","BSP1004","FNA1002/ACC1002 and BSP1004","FNA3111 or ACC3601","FNA2004/FIN2004 and BSP1004","FNA3121 or ACC3603","FNA2004 or FIN2004","Depends on the particular stream offered.
